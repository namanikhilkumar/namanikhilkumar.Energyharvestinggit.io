            <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
            <p>Energy harvesting technologies have gained significant attention over the past two decades as alternatives to conventional power sources for small-sized and low-power electronic devices. The need for periodic recharging or replacement of batteries has been a consistent issue for portable, remote, and implantable devices.</p>
            <h3>Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition and Mechanism:</strong> Piezoelectric energy harvesting converts dynamic mechanical energy into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials. This method focuses on harvesting low-level energy (microwatts to milliwatts) to power low-power electronics.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Piezoelectric transduction is advantageous over thermal and solar harvesting because ambient vibrations are persistent due to operational conditions, making it reliable and useful in embedded systems where thermal and solar energy might be absent.</p>
            <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Common applications include providing energy for low-power electronics such as embedded electronics, implantable biomedical devices, wireless sensor nodes, and portable electronics. These systems offer a permanent, autonomous power source, reducing costs associated with battery replacement and enabling deployment in remote or embedded locations.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>

The cantilever's dimensions were optimized to enhance energy conversion efficiency. A copper cantilever, with dimensions 500 µm × 100 µm × 2 µm, was selected to effectively capture electrons from the Nickel-63 source.</p>
